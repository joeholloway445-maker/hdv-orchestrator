/**
 * companion/handlers.ts — request handler for companion chat (companion/).
 *
 * Mirrors market/handlers.ts: a pure-ish function that takes parsed input and returns
 * `{ status, body }`, unit-testable without binding a port, wired into the gateway's route
 * table with a single line. Owns no transport.
 *
 * Provider use here is the SAME pattern as hope/enricher.ts: a pure text transducer
 * (`complete(prompt) -> { text }`), dependency-injected, optional, and never used to route,
 * execute, or create. The only difference from the enricher is the prompt shape (in-character
 * companion reply vs. one-line intent paraphrase) and the deterministic fallback pool.
 *
 * Persistent memory (companion/memory.ts) is layered on ENTIRELY OPT-IN, gated on the client
 * supplying `companionId` AND a `memoryRepository` being injected (see CompanionChatOptions).
 * With either one missing, behavior is EXACTLY the stateless behavior above — zero change.
