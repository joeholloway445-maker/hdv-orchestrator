/**
 * providers/types.ts — the LlmProvider contract.
 *
 * This package is a thin, dependency-free seam for OPTIONAL large-language-model access.
 * It exists so higher layers (e.g. HOPE, when explicitly given a provider) can enrich
 * *text* — never behavior. A provider turns a prompt into text; it has no knowledge of
 * agents, packets, routing, KNOLL, or the ledger, and MUST never be used to execute or
 * create anything in the system.
 *
 * Design goals:
 *   - Offline-first: the DEFAULT provider (StubProvider) always works with no network.
 *   - No hard SDK dependency: HTTP providers use the global `fetch`, not vendor SDKs.
 *   - Minimal surface: one method, `complete(prompt, opts) -> { text, model, usage }`.
