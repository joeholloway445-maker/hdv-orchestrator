/**
 * providers/image_types.ts — the ImageProvider contract.
 *
 * Sibling seam to providers/types.ts (LlmProvider), same design goals: a thin, dependency-free,
 * OPTIONAL seam so higher layers (companion/portrait_handlers.ts) can turn a text prompt into
 * an image — never behavior. An image provider has no knowledge of agents, packets, routing,
 * KNOLL, or the ledger, and MUST never be used to execute or create anything in the system
 * beyond the image bytes it returns.
 *
 * Design goals:
 *   - Offline-first: the DEFAULT provider (StubImageProvider) always works with no network.
 *   - No hard SDK dependency: HTTP providers use the global `fetch`, not vendor SDKs.
 *   - Minimal surface: one method, `generate(prompt, opts) -> ImageResult`.
 *   - Provider-agnostic: callers never know or care whether the image came from a hosted API
 *     (Google AI Studio) or a self-hosted model behind a tunnel (Colab). Swapping the env var
 *     is the only change needed.
