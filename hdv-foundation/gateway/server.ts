/**
 * gateway/server.ts — Phase 4 HTTP API Gateway: HOPE's forward-facing presence.
 *
 * HOPE is the interface layer / master interpreter, but until now it had no network face.
 * This gateway gives HOPE an HTTP surface so external clients can submit natural-language
 * intents and read system state. It is a COMPOSITION ROOT (like the demos): it wires HOPE
 * + DREAM + VISION handlers into an ApexOrchestrator via dependency injection. It is NOT a
 * peer agent and holds no business logic of its own.
 *
 * INVARIANTS PRESERVED:
 *   - The gateway NEVER bypasses APEX. Every intent is submitted HOPE → APEX, and APEX
 *     calls KNOLL before routing. The gateway has no direct handle on DREAM/VISION beyond
 *     the DI wiring; it cannot address them directly.
 *   - The gateway imports no peer-to-peer edges: peers still only receive packets from
 *     APEX. Read endpoints (ledger/audit) are read-only projections.
 *   - Zero third-party deps: built on node:http only, and kept modular so the transport
 *     (http, a framework, or a serverless handler) can be swapped without touching HOPE.
 *
 * Handlers are exposed as pure-ish methods (`handleIntent`, `handleHealth`, ...) that
 * return `{ status, body }`, so they can be tested WITHOUT binding a port. `createServer`
 * / `listen` wrap them for real HTTP.
